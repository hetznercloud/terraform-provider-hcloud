# hcloud_zone_rrset (Resource)

Provides a Hetzner Cloud Zone Resource Record Set (RRSet) resource.

This can be used to create, modify, and delete Zone RRSets.

See the [Zone RRSets API documentation](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/reference/cloud#zone-rrsets) for more details.

**RRSets of type TXT:**

The format of TXT records must consist of one or many quoted strings of 255 characters.

A helper function to format TXT record is available at `provider::hcloud::txt_record`.
See the examples for more details.

**RRSets of type SOA:**

SOA records are created or deleted by the Hetzner Cloud API when creating or deleting
the parent Zone, therefor this Terraform resource will:

- import the RRSet in the state, instead of creating it.
- remove the RRSet from the state, instead of deleting it.
- set the SOA record SERIAL value to 0 before saving it to the state, as this value is automatically
  incremented by the API and would cause issues otherwise.

**Experimental:** DNS API is in beta, breaking changes may occur within minor releases.
See https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog#2025-10-07-dns-beta for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hcloud_zone" "example" {
  name = "example.com"
  mode = "primary"
}

resource "hcloud_zone_rrset" "example" {
  zone = hcloud_zone.example.name
  name = "www"
  type = "A"

  ttl = 10800

  labels = {
    key = "value"
  }

  records = [
    { value = "201.78.10.45", comment = "web server 1" },
  ]

  change_protection = false
}

resource "hcloud_zone_rrset" "example_txt" {
  zone = hcloud_zone.example.name
  name = "@"
  type = "TXT"
  records = [
    # Format the record using the txt_record helper
    { value = provider::hcloud::txt_record("v=spf1 include:_spf.example.net ~all") },
    # Or manually
    { value = "\"v=spf1 include:_spf.example.net ~all\"" },
  ]
}

resource "hcloud_zone_rrset" "example_soa" {
  zone = hcloud_zone.example.name
  name = "@"
  type = "SOA"

  records = [
    // SOA record SERIAL value will be set to 0, before saving it to the state. Make
    // sure to use 0 as SERIAL value to prevent running into inconsistent state errors.
    { value = "hydrogen.ns.hetzner.com. dns.hetzner.com. 0 86400 10800 3600000 3600" }
    //                                                   ^ here
  ]
}

- `records` (Attributes List) Records of the Zone RRSet. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--records))
- `type` (String) Type of the Zone RRSet.
- `zone` (String) ID or Name of the parent Zone.

### Optional

- `change_protection` (Boolean) Whether change protection is enabled.
- `labels` (Map of String) User-defined [labels](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/reference/cloud#labels) (key-value pairs) for the resource.
- `ttl` (Number) Time To Live (TTL) of the Zone RRSet.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ID of the Zone RRSet.

<a id="nestedatt--records"></a>
### Nested Schema for `records`

Required:

- `value` (String) Value of the record.

Optional:

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = hcloud_zone_rrset.example
  id = "$ZONE_ID_OR_NAME/$RRSET_NAME/$RRSET_TYPE"
}

import {
  to = hcloud_zone_rrset.example
  id = "$ZONE_ID_OR_NAME/$RRSET_ID"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import hcloud_zone_rrset.example "$ZONE_ID_OR_NAME/$RRSET_NAME/$RRSET_TYPE"
terraform import hcloud_zone_rrset.example "$ZONE_ID_OR_NAME/$RRSET_ID"
```
