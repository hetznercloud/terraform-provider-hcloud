# Data Source: hcloud_primary_ip

Provides details about a Hetzner Cloud Primary IP.

This resource can be useful when you need to determine a Primary IP ID based on the IP address.

Side note:

If a server is getting created, it has to have a primary ip. If a server is getting created without defining primary ips, two of them (one ipv4 and one ipv6) getting created & attached.
Currently, Primary IPs can be only attached to servers.
