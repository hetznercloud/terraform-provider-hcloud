# hcloud_primary_ip

Provides a Hetzner Cloud Primary IP to represent a publicly-accessible static IP address that can be mapped to one of your servers.

If a server is getting created, it has to have a primary ip. If a server is getting created without defining primary ips, two of them (one ipv4 and one ipv6) getting created & attached.
Currently, Primary IPs can be only attached to servers.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "hcloud_primary_ip" "main" {
  name          = "primary_ip_test"
  datacenter    = "fsn1-dc14"
  type          = "ipv4"
  assignee_type = "server"
  auto_delete   = true
  labels = {
    "hallo" : "welt"
  }
}
// Link a server to a primary IP
resource "hcloud_server" "server_test" {
  name        = "test-server"
  image       = "ubuntu-20.04"
  server_type = "cx11"
  datacenter  = "fsn1-dc14"
  labels = {
    "test" : "tessst1"
  }
  public_net {
    ipv4 = hcloud_primary_ip.main.id
  }
