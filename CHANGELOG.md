## 1.26.1 (May 28, 2021)

BUG FIXES:
* `hcloud_firewall` datasource: `destination_ips` missed in definition

  (#359)

## 1.26.0 (March 30, 2021)

* **Deprecated Resource** `hcloud_certificate`

## 1.25.2 (March 16, 2021)

## 1.25.1 (March 10, 2021)

BUG FIXES:
* `hcloud_firewall` documentation: fix name of `firewall_ids` property.

## 1.25.0 (March 10, 2021)

FEATURES:
* **New Resource**: `hcloud_snapshot`
* **New Resource**: `hcloud_firewall`
* **New Data Source**: `hcloud_firewall`

BUG FIXES:
* `hcloud_server` resource: image had a wrong type (int instead of string) when a server was created from a snapshot
* `hcloud_load_balancer_target` resource: force recreation when changing a target attribute (server_id, ip or label_selector)

NOTES:
* The provider is now built with Go 1.16

## 1.24.1 (February 04, 2021)

BUG FIXES:
* `hcloud_volume` datasource: id is now marked as computed to allow more setups where the id is unknown
* `hcloud_ssh_key` datasource: id is now marked as computed to allow more setups where the id is unknown
* `hcloud_network` datasource: id is now marked as computed to allow more setups where the id is unknown
* `hcloud_image` datasource: id is now marked as computed to allow more setups where the id is unknown
* `hcloud_certificate` datasource: id is now marked as computed to allow more setups where the id is unknown

Notes:
* This release is tested against Terraform 0.13.x and 0.14.x. Testing on 0.12.x was removed, therefore Terraform 0.12.x is no longer officially supported

  `hcloud_server_network` resources.

## 1.20.0 (August 10, 2020)

FEATURES:

* Allow updating/resizing a Load Balancer through the
  `load_balancer_type` of `hcloud_load_balancer` resource
* Add support for Load Balancer Label Selector and IP targets.

## 1.19.2 (July 28, 2020)

CHANGED:

* Deprecate `network_id` property of `hcloud_server_network` and
  `hcloud_load_balancer_network` resources. Introduce a `subnet_id`
  property as replacement.

  Both resources require a subnet to be created. Since `network_id`
  references the network and not the subnet there is no explicit
  dependency between those resources. This leads to Terraform creating
  those resources in parallel, which creates a race condition. Users
  stuck with the `network_id` property can create an explicit dependency
  on the subnet using `depends_on` to work around this issue.

BUG FIXES:
* Enable and Disable `proxyprotocol` on a Load Balancer didn't work after creation
* Deleted all Load Balancer services when you changed the `listen_port` of one service
* `hcloud_load_balancer_target` was not idempotent when you add a target that was already defined
