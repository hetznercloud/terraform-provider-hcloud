# hcloud_primary_ip

Provides a Hetzner Cloud Primary IP to represent a publicly-accessible static IP address that can be mapped to one of your servers.

If a server is getting created, it has to have a primary ip. If a server is getting created without defining primary ips, two of them (one ipv4 and one ipv6) getting created & attached.
Currently, Primary IPs can be only attached to servers.

## Deprecations

### `datacenter` attribute

The `datacenter` attribute is deprecated, use the `location` attribute instead.

See our the [API changelog](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog#2025-12-16-phasing-out-datacenters) for more details.

-> Please upgrade to `v1.58.0+` of the provider to avoid issues once the Hetzner Cloud API no longer accepts
and returns the `datacenter` attribute. This version of the provider remains backward compatible by preserving
the `datacenter` value in the state and by extracting the `location` name from the `datacenter` attribute when
communicating with the API.

## Example Usage

## Argument Reference

- `type` - (string) Type of the Primary IP. `ipv4` or `ipv6`
- `name` - (string) Name of the Primary IP.
- `location` - (string, optional) The location name to create the resource in. See the [Hetzner Docs](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/general/locations/#what-locations-are-there) for more details about locations.
- `datacenter` - (string, optional, deprecated) The datacenter name to create the resource in. See the [Hetzner Docs](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/general/locations/#what-datacenters-are-there) for more details about datacenters.
- `auto_delete` - (bool) Whether auto delete is enabled.
  `Important note:`It is recommended to set `auto_delete` to `false`, because if a server assigned to the managed ip is getting deleted, it will also delete the primary IP which will break the TF state.
- `labels` - (map, optional) User-defined labels (key-value pairs).
- `assignee_id` - (int, optional) ID of the assigned resource.
- `assignee_type` - (string) The type of the assigned resource. Currently supported: `server`
- `delete_protection` - (bool, optional) Whether delete protection is enabled. See ["Delete Protection"](../index.html.markdown#delete-protection) in the Provider Docs for details.
