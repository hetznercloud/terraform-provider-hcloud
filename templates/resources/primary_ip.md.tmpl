# hcloud_primary_ip

Provides a Hetzner Cloud Primary IP to represent a publicly-accessible static IP address that can be mapped to one of your servers.

If a server is getting created, it has to have a primary ip. If a server is getting created without defining primary ips, two of them (one ipv4 and one ipv6) getting created & attached.
Currently, Primary IPs can be only attached to servers.

## Example Usage
