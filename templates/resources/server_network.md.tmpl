# hcloud_server_network

Provides a Hetzner Cloud Server Network to represent a private network on a server in the Hetzner Cloud.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile .ExampleFile }}

## Argument Reference

- `server_id` - (Required, int) ID of the server.
- `alias_ips` - (Optional, list[string]) Additional IPs to be assigned
  to this server.
- `network_id` - (Optional, int) ID of the network which should be added
  to the server. Required if `subnet_id` is not set. Successful creation
  of the resource depends on the existence of a subnet in the Hetzner
  Cloud Backend. Using `network_id` will not create an explicit
  dependency between server and subnet. Therefore `depends_on` may need
  to be used. Alternatively the `subnet_id` property can be used, which
  will create an explicit dependency between `hcloud_server_network` and
  the existence of a subnet.
- `subnet_id` - (Optional, string) ID of the sub-network which should be
  added to the Server. Required if `network_id` is not set.
  _Note_: if the `ip` property is missing, the Server is currently added
  to the last created subnet.
- `ip` - (Optional, string) IP to request to be assigned to this server.
  If you do not provide this then you will be auto assigned an IP
  address.

## Attributes Reference

- `id` - (string) ID of the server network.
- `network_id` - (int) ID of the network.
- `server_id` - (int) ID of the server.
- `ip` - (string) IP assigned to this server.
- `alias_ips` - (list[string]) Additional IPs assigned to this server.

## Import

Server Network entries can be imported using a compound ID with the following format:
`<server-id>-<network-id>`
