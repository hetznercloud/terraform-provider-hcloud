# Hetzner Cloud Provider

The Hetzner Cloud (hcloud) provider is used to interact with the resources supported by [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile .ExampleFile }}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `token` - (Required, string) This is the Hetzner Cloud API Token, can also be specified with the `HCLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable.
- `endpoint` - (Optional, string) Hetzner Cloud API endpoint, can be used to override the default API Endpoint `https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1`.
- `poll_interval` - (Optional, string) Configures the interval in which actions are polled by the client. Default `500ms`. Increase this interval if you run into rate limiting errors.
- `poll_function` - (Optional, string) Configures the type of function to be used during the polling. Valid values are `constant` and `exponential`. Default `exponential`.

## Delete Protection

The Hetzner Cloud API allows to protect resources from deletion by putting a "lock" on them.
This can also be configured through Terraform through the `delete_protection` argument on resources that support it.

Please note, that this does not protect deletion from Terraform itself, as the Provider will lift the lock in that case.
If you also want to protect your resources from deletion by Terraform, you can use the [`prevent_destroy` lifecycle attribute](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/resource-lifecycle#prevent-resource-deletion).
